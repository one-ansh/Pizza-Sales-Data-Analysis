Pizza Sales Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data to uncover key business insights, identify trends, and evaluate performance metrics (KPIs). The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations that can help a pizza business optimize its operations, marketing strategies, and product offerings.

Key Features & Analysis Performed

*Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Calculation and analysis of crucial metrics such as:
    * Total Revenue
    * Average Order Value
    * Total Pizzas Sold
    * Total Orders
    * Average Pizzas Per Order
 **Daily & Hourly Sales Trends:** Analyzing order patterns throughout the day and week to identify peak hours and days, useful for staffing and promotional planning.
 **Sales by Pizza Category & Size:** Understanding the most popular pizza categories and sizes to inform inventory and marketing efforts.
 **Top/Bottom Performing Pizzas:** Identifying best-selling and worst-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue, which can guide menu adjustments.

## Tools and Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** For initial data cleaning, transformation (using features like Pivot Tables and Power Query, if applicable), and generating some foundational insights and visualizations.
* **SQL (Structured Query Language):** For querying and aggregating data from the `pizza_sales` dataset to extract specific metrics and trends.


 Dataset

The primary dataset used for this analysis is `pizza_sales.csv`. It contains detailed records of pizza orders, including:
* `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order.
* `order_date`: Date of the order.
* `order_time`: Time of the order.
* `pizza_id`: Unique identifier for each pizza sold.
* `pizza_name`: Name of the pizza.
* `pizza_category`: Category of the pizza (e.g., Classic, Veggie).
* `pizza_size`: Size of the pizza (e.g., S, M, L).
* `pizza_price`: Price of the individual pizza.
* `quantity`: Number of pizzas of that type in the order.
* `total_price`: Total price for that specific pizza line item.



 Project Structure

* `pizza_sales.csv`: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
* `PIZZA SALES SQL QUERIES.docx`: Contains all the SQL queries used to extract KPIs, trends, and other insights.
* `project1(SQL+Excel).xlsx - KPI.csv`: Exported KPI results from analysis.
* `project1(SQL+Excel).xlsx - Best and Worst sellers.csv`: Exported data on top/bottom performing pizzas.
* `project1(SQL+Excel).xlsx - Trends for total order.csv`: Exported data on daily/hourly trends.
* `project1(SQL+Excel).xlsx - Sheet1.csv`: (If this contains specific cleaned data or intermediate steps, you can describe it; otherwise, consider removing or renaming for clarity).

Analysis Highlights & Insights

Based on the analysis, some key insights include:

 1.The **Total Revenue** stands at $817860.05, with an **Average Order Value** of $38.38, indicating good sales overall.
 2.Weekends and evenings  show the highest order volumes, suggesting these are critical periods for staffing and promotions.
